Created as a fun way to discover interesting color combinations. Palettes are hand-selected from the Twitter bot [@colorschemez](https://twitter.com/colorschemez). The feed randomly generates color combinations as well as their descriptions, with each color being matched with an adjective from a list of over 20,000 words.
